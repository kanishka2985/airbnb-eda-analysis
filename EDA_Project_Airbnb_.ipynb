        "\n",
        "The objective of this project was to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world Airbnb dataset to uncover meaningful insights that can help improve host strategy, platform efficiency, and guest experience. By leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we examined trends across prices, availability, reviews, and host behavior. The dataset included listings from various neighborhoods, room types, host activity metrics, and temporal review data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, we cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values in columns like reviews_per_month and last_review, and created new features such as price_per_night (derived from price and minimum nights) and review_rate_indicator (a categorization of listings based on their review activity). This enriched dataset allowed for deeper and more interpretable analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "A central part of the analysis was understanding room type popularity. We generated count plots and average pricing comparisons that revealed that \"Entire home/apartment\" listings dominate in terms of pricing and quantity, followed by \"Private rooms\". However, \"Shared rooms\" and \"Hotel rooms\" were the least common, suggesting limited demand or host willingness to share spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also investigated how neighborhood and location (latitude/longitude) influence listing behavior. By plotting average price and availability by neighborhood group, we observed that central areas (like Manhattan) typically have the highest prices and lowest availability, whereas outer neighborhoods (like the Bronx or Queens) offer more availability at lower prices. A geographic scatter plot using latitude and longitude helped visualize density clusters, highlighting property \"hotspots\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Temporal trends were another major focus. By converting last_review into datetime format and grouping reviews by month and year, we created line plots to explore seasonal engagement. These graphs indicated that reviews spike during mid-year months, likely reflecting summer travel peaks. Additionally, we explored how reviews_per_month varied with room type and location to identify which types of listings maintain consistent customer engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another dimension of the project involved understanding host behavior. We grouped hosts by the number of listings they manage and compared this with their average reviews per month. This led to identifying \"super hosts\" with multiple listings and high engagement.Box plots were used to show the distribution of availability and pricing across different room types and activity indicators, giving insights into how commercial vs. occasional hosts behave.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advanced plots such as pair plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices were used to identify strong relationships among variables like price, availability, and review activity. For instance, we found that availability_365 is weakly correlated with price, while reviews_per_month has a stronger relationship with the number of reviews and host listing count.\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, this project delivered a detailed analytical view of Airbnb listings by breaking down factors that affect price, availability, engagement, and host activity. Visualizations like line plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, bar charts, and violin plots provided an interactive and intuitive understanding of the data. The analysis not only helps hosts optimize listing strategies but also aids Airbnb in understanding market dynamics across different urban zones and times of the year.\n",
